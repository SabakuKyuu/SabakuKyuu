### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Matthew, Python Developer willing to learn and gain first professional experience. 
I have knowledge of Python object-oriented programming and unit testing. 
I try to expand my knowledge every day by writing my own projects and learning from the courses.

I have the skills to work in a team, a positive attitude to work and willingness to develop, openness to learning and new working methods.
The first project made me realize that programming is my passion. In the future I would like to be a full-stack developer.
